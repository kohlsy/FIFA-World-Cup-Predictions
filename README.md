Predicting the Winner of the 2018 FIFA World Cup

Using past data and statistics from the past two years after the Euros, I developed a rating for each team and used that to determine the winner of all matches played in the world cup group stages. The same process followed for all the rounds until the final where Brazil were predicted to be the winners of the tournament.

The model was correctly able to predict quarterfinal games played between France & Uruguay and Brazil & Belgium and in both cases the predicted winners of these matches were also the winners in real life.

Ultimately, although Brazil did unexpectedly get knocked out in the quarterfinal, this model suggests that had they won that match it is likely they could have gone on to win the whole tournament.
